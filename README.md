# 🚀 Design of Data Structures (DDS) – Codes & Notes

Welcome to the **Design of Data Structures (DDS)** repository! 🎉  
This repo contains **well-structured C++ implementations, pseudocodes, and explanations** of all data structure concepts covered in the **B.Tech Semester 3 syllabus**.  

👉 The goal: Help students **understand, practice, and revise** DSA concepts quickly.
